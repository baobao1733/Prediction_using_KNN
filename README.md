📊 Machine Learning Projects – KNN Based Predictions

This repository contains end-to-end Machine Learning projects demonstrating the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for both classification and regression problems.
Each project follows the complete Machine Learning Life Cycle, from problem understanding to business impact.

🚀 Use Case 1: iPhone Purchase Prediction (KNN Classifier)
🎯 Objective

To predict whether a customer will purchase an iPhone based on:

Gender

Age

Estimated Salary

This helps retail stores identify high-potential customers and optimize marketing strategies.

⚙️ Solution Overview

Analyzed customer demographic data

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand buying behavior

Applied feature encoding and scaling

Built a KNN Classification model

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

🔍 Key Insights

Age and Estimated Salary are the strongest predictors of iPhone purchase

Higher-income and middle-aged customers are more likely to buy

Gender has minimal influence on purchasing decisions

Feature scaling significantly improves KNN model performance

💼 Business Impact

Improved customer targeting

Reduced marketing costs

Higher conversion rates through personalized campaigns

Data-driven decision-making for sales teams

🏠 Use Case 2: Bangalore House Price Prediction (KNN Regressor)
🎯 Objective

To predict the price of houses in Bangalore using property features:

Total square footage

Number of BHKs, bathrooms, and balconies

Price per square foot

This supports buyers, sellers, and real estate platforms with accurate price estimates.

⚙️ Solution Overview

Used historical Bangalore housing data

Conducted detailed EDA to analyze price trends and feature relationships

Applied feature scaling for distance-based learning

Built a KNN Regression model

Evaluated model using RMSE and R² score

🔍 Key Insights

Total square footage and price per square foot are the most influential features

Higher BHK and bathroom counts generally increase property value

House price distribution is right-skewed due to premium properties

KNN captures local pricing patterns effectively after scaling

💼 Business Impact

Fair and accurate house price estimation

Improved buyer and seller decision-making

Can be integrated into real estate platforms for instant valuation

Helps reduce overpricing and underpricing risks
